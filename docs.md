# Decorators (events)

* `@on_start`:
Same as Scratch's `On Start` block. Runs the functions when the program starts. The order is the same as the order the functions were declared in.

* `@on_key(Keys.key)`
This adds an event handler for a key. `Keys` contains all the keys `pygame` offers.


# Built-in functions

* `say(msg)`
Same as Scratch's  `say`. Show `msg` on screen.

* `exit()`
Quit the program.

* `start()`
Start the program. It will run until `exit()` is called.

# To do:
Input, move functions, sound functions, make it look nicer, wait, print for x seconds.

* `ask()`
Allows user input, blocking.
